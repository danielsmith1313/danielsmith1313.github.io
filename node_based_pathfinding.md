## Autonomous Navigation Using Node Based Pathfinding

Source code available [here](https://github.com/danielsmith1313/nasa-ne-2019).

**Project description:** This project, funded through the NASA Nebraska Space Grant, focused on being able to program an educational GoPiGo robot to navigate with existing GPS coordinates. The project started with self guided learning of the python programming language in order to control the
robot. After that, the project involved creating a user interface and programming obstacle avoidance as well as node based pathfinding. For the node based pathfinding, I used [Dijkstra's Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm) to find the shortest path from a theoretical starting point to an ending point.




One major challenge of this project was the organization of code. Due to this being my first major independent and educational project, I did not have enough knowledge about organization of my project. Since then, I have learned about creating class and folder structures for every project. However, I did make sure to comment and document my code. While documenting in general is one of the fundementals of coding, it also helped me challenge myself to understand the code I was writing. This led to easier debugging and overall understanding. 


What I learned the most from this project was that it gave me a different view of programming when compared to my college classes. I think this set the stage
