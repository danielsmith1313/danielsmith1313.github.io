## Autonomous Navigation Using Node Based Pathfinding

Source code available [here](https://github.com/danielsmith1313/nasa-ne-2019).

**Project description:** This project, funded through the NASA Nebraska Space Grant, focused on being able to program an educational GoPiGo robot
to navigate with existing GPS coordinates. The project started with self guided learning of the python programming language in order to control the
robot. After that, the project involved creating a user interface and programming obstacle avoidance as well as node based pathfinding. For the node
based pathfinding, I used Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from a theoretical starting point to an ending point.

### 3. Challenges and Future Use of this Project

One major challenge of this project was the organization of code. Due to this being my first major independent and educational project, I did not have enough knowledge about organization of my project. Additionally, looking back on this code, my methods for bugfixing and  Another issue with this project was that the implementation of the project did not contain any real life data due to time and budget constraints. I believe that this taught me to better modularize my code. Additionally, it helped me to realize if there is a bug in the code, the best way to deal with it is dealing with the root issue instead of finding a workaround. The main goal of this project was to create a node based pathfinding system that would be used to find a safe path for a ground based vehicle along with gps and/or LIDAR. Specifically, as this was funded by NASA, this project would be useful on a foriegn planet where there would be many unknown factors that the robot would encounter.
